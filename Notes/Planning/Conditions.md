## Dealing with Challenges
Accept that this is a job. You go to work in the morning and then you work until the evening. Do not rely on motivation, but on habits. Just as with physical activity.

Understand what this project means to you, it is an opportunity to prove that you can do this.
## Investors
Evaluate the state of the project at the end of the year. Is there potential for investors? 
## Expectations
Looking at my conditions, it is fair to assume that I have time for a very small project, relative to the size of a game jam. I need to rely on techniques that I have used before, or where I predict little resistance. I need to use tutorials. 

The game loop should be simple and I should stick to the bare minimum.

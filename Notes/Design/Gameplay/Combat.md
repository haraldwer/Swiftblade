Melee. Focus on combining movement abilities with a basic attack. Strike and block. 

- Strike - There is a short cooldown. The time window for hits is quite big. Multiple things can be damaged by the same strike. Strike is also used to unlock checkpoints by breaking a crystal. 
    
- Block - Only certain damage can be blocked. How can this be communicated to the player? What kind of damage should be blockable? There is damage from obstacles, projectiles or enemies. 
    

  

There are a number of special attacks that can be unlocked throughout the game:

- AOE - Strike the ground to cause damage on all enemies within a radius. 
    
- Throw - Throw the sword like in God of War
    
- Thrust - An attack with longer range where the sword is thrusted forwards
    
- Blink - The player can kill multiple enemies at once with one click by teleporting
    

How should these be used by the player? What buttons to activate etc?

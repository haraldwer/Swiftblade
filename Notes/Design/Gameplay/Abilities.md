Abilities are bound to the magic of the sword, and can only be used once the sword has been picked up. Some abilities are unlocked as you play. 

- Double Jump - The player can jump in the air. 
    
- Wall Running - The player can run on certain walls if the player keeps a certain speed and if the player looks along the wall. This can be cancelled by looking away from the wall or by jumping. Jumping while wallrunning will give a speed boost away from the wall. 
    
- Wall Climbing - The player can climb certain walls by pressing towards and looking at the wall. The player can transition from wallclimb to wallrun and back. The distance that can be climbed is limited. The player also needs speed when reaching the wall in order to initiate a climb. The player can climb sideways. 
    
- Wall sitting - The player can sit on the wall. This happens when the velocity is low during wallrun or wallclimb. 
    
- Dash - The player can dash a short distance. The player does not fall or take damage during the dash. The direction is based on the current acceleration. 
    
- Grappling Hook - The player can pull themselves towards certain points in the level. The point closed to the middle of the screen is prioritized. Only points within a certain distance are considered. Effects show the currently prioritized point. 
    
- Slide / Crouch - The player can crouch to walk slower and become shorter. The player can crouch while moving to start sliding. The player will then glide along the floor with a set direction for a set duration, or until slide is cancelled. Crouch is not bound by magic. 
    
- Boost pad - When the player touches this object, the player will receive a speed boost in the direction of the object rotation. The distance is always the same. 
    
- Zipline - When the player touches this object, the player will stick to the bottom of the object and slide along it. The player can control the speed and direction. The player can jump off at any time and will automatically detach when reaching the end. 
    
- Crystals - The player can strike this object to get a speed boost. Currently the speed boost is directed away from the crystal, but this might be flipped to be towards instead. On hit, the crystal breaks. 

Abilities will be unlocked one at a time throughout the game. This keeps the game interesting and lets the player progress and become more powerful.

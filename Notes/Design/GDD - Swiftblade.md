A movement-focused FPS
# Introduction
You are on your way to steal a legendary sword from the great wizard. You have reached the central chamber and in front of you the sharp blade shimmers as it floats. It’s time, now or never. You reach out and take a firm grip. In that moment, you realize what you’ve done. 

The sword explodes in a bright clear-blue flame and you’re blinded by the light. In this freezing heat you clearly feel that you’re standing in front of him, and he sees you. 

“The sword is mine”. You’re unable to move in his cold grip. “Only the worthy can escape my domain”. The flame of the sword settles down, you’re still alive. Will you be able to escape the castle? 

This is a game with focus on movement and parkour, melee-combat and magical abilities. The gameplay-design is similar to Ghostrunner and Ultrakill, with speedrunning being a major component.

Low Poly. Medieval, macabre and grotesque. A bleak world with almost no color. There are exceptions, but primarily for gameplay purposes.

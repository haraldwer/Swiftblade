## Chapters & Theme
The game is split up into chapters with unique themes. Currently, two chapters are planned; Indoors and outdoors. These first two chapters are focused on introducing the game to the player and will be the goal for an early alpha build. 

The player can select a chapter from a menu before starting. The player can only select chapters that have previously been completed or the next uncompleted chapter.
## Skill progression and Difficulty
Each chapter introduces a set of abilities, obstacles and enemies. This makes it easier to plan game progression and slowly increase difficulty. The order of introducing abilities, obstacles and enemies is always the same. 
## Randomness
The order of sections and arenas is always the same for the chapter. The order of rooms in each section is randomized.

These levels contain enemies. When all enemies are defeated a glowing crystal will appear. When the player breaks this crystal, the player will be transported to the next section. 

Arenas are created in the same way as normal rooms, but without exits. Arenas also contain a number of enemy spawners and an enemy preset. 

Some arenas are built to let the player use a certain ability.

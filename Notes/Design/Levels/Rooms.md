## Unique rooms
There are some rooms that always appear in the same order, which are there to tie together obstacle-courses and arenas. 
### Section start
The first room in a level has a visual language that explains that this works as a checkpoint that the player reaches after defeating an arena. When the player defeats an arena, the player breaks a crystal. The idea is that the player is sucked into the crystal and teleported to this room. The room contains a symmetrical shape on the ground that has a blue glow to show that this is a place of magic. 
### Section end
The last room in a level contains a great door that the player has to pass through in order to get to the arena. The door and the room has a visual language that leads the player to the door and explains that this is how to progress. It should feel epic. 
### Game start
The first room is the chamber with the sword. The player has to pick up the sword in order to exit the room. 
### Game end
A unique room that clearly explains that this is the end of the chapter. 
Does the player exit the castle for every chapter?
